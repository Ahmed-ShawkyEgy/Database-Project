Hello and Welcome,
Thanks for taking some of your time to check our site.
Please follow the following instructions to view the site properly.

2) Have the project file in the C:\xampp\htdocs directory
3) Change the directory in the databaseConnection.php of the $serverName to the server name of your pc, the one you use in visual studio to connect to the database, and $connectionInfo to the name of the database
4) please be online while viewing the project as we import some libraries, and pictures through the internet
5) Open the site through the StartSession.php that is in the Launcher folder
